# Count Me Up Scotty

Start from the classroom demo code or from this repository: [https://github.com/vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/count-me-up-scotty](https://github.com/vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/count-me-up-scotty).

First move the classes `Player`, `Game` and `SumChallenge` to a `.NET Standard Class Library`. Make sure that the console application keeps working.

Next create a new `WPF App (.NET Framework)`.

First create the graphical user interface. No need to add any code or behavior in the first steps.

Make sure to be creative. Experiment and make this application your own.

## Step 1 - Login Window

Create a login window using the WPF that has the following components:

* A title
* A textbox for the user's name
* A login button to switch to the next window

## Step 2 - Play Window

Next create a play window that allows the user to play the game. It needs:

* a title
* a start button
* a nicely styled text block that shows the challenge
* a textbox that allows the user to input his/her anwser
* a button to solve the challenge

Possible extra's:

* a text block that displays the current time
* a progress bar that displays the challenge progress

## Unit Tests

This project has no working unit tests at this moment.

## Remark

This challenge is an early draft. Still work in progress.
