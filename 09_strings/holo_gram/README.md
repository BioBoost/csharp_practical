# HoloGram

A pangram (Greek: pan gramma, "all letters") or holo-alphabetical sentence is a sentence in which all letters of the alphabet appear. The challenge is to make as short a sentence as possible that meets this condition. A very well-known example is `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`.

The class `PangramChecker` allows the user to check if a sentence is a pangram by means of the method `IsPangram()`.

Your task (also see `View => Task List` in Visual Studio):

* Implement the method `IsPangram()` in the class `PangramChecker` so it checks if the string `text` contains all the letters of the alphabet.
* Make sure to convert the string to all lowercase first.

## Expected output

```text
Welcome to Pangram checker.
The most famous pangram is:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
This application agrees that this is a pangram.
```
