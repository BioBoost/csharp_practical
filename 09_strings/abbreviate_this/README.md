# Abbreviate This

Abbreviate This is an application that can transform a `string` containing a number of words into an abbreviation of those words. It can for example transform "rolling on floor laughing" into "ROFL".

The class `Abbreviator` should implement the transformation from text to abbreviation. This is your job.

Your task (also see `View => Task List` in Visual Studio):

* Implement the method `Abbreviate` in the class `Abbreviator` so it converts the string in `text` to an abbreviation (first letter of each word)
* Make sure that the letters in the end-result are all upper-case.
* If the variable `text` references an empty `string`, than make sure to return an empty string as well.

## Expected output

```text
Welcome to Abbreviate This ...
LOL means Laughing Out Loud
```
