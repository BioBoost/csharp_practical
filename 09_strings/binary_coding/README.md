# Binary Coding

Binary Coding determines the decimal representation of a binary value.

The class `BinaryConverter` has a method `ToDecimal()` that performs the conversion from a binary value to a decimal value. It just lacks some implementation.

Your task (also see `View => Task List` in Visual Studio):

* Implement the method `ToDecimal()` in the class `BinaryConverter` so it converts the `binary` string into a decimal value.
* Do note that the binary value can contain any number of spaces. These need to be ignored.
* The string can also start with a `b`character. This is typically required in programming languages such as C. You can ignore this starting character.

## Verwachte output

```text
Binary converter can convert a binary number to decimal.
Try it out. Just enter a binary value here:
b1000 1111
This equals 143
```

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.

## Solution

The solution can be found as a second project in the Visual Studio Solution under the name `Solution`.
