# Reversal

This application allows the user to enter a tex. The application will then reverse the order of the characters and return the result to the user.

Implement the method `Reverse(string text)` in the class `StringReverser` so it returns the given string with the characters reversed.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
