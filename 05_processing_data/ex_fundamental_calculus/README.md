# Fundamental Calculus

This app models a basic calculator. Implement all the methods of the `Calculator` class so they return the correct values.

The `Add()` method has already been implemented to provide you with an example.

You can also extend the `Main()` with more code to test your implementation.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
