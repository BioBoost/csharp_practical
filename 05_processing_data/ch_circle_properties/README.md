# Circle Properties

Create a .NET Core app that determines the area and circumference of a circle. These properties can be calculated using the formulas:

```math
area = radius x radius x pi
circumference = 2 x radius x pi
```

Make sure all the variables are of type `double`. Just place all your code in the `Main` method.

Print all the parameters to the terminal (radius, diameter, area and circumference) so the user had a nice overview. For example:

```text
Hello and welcome to the Circle Properties app.

Properties of circle:
- radius: 2.15 meters
- diameter: 4.30 meters
- circumference: 13.51 meters
- area: 14.52 square meters

Thank you for using the app.
```

You can create a variable to hold an approximation to the value of pi. However, C# can supply a more accurate version of PI. Can you find on the Internet how to access/use this value?
