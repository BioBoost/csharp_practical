# Pythagoras

Search the Internet for the Pythagorean theorem. It is a mathematical relation between the lengths of the sides of right hand triangles.

The formula is:

The class `RightHandTriangle` defines three methods (`DetermineA()`, `DetermineB()` and `DetermineC()`) to calculate the different side length if the other two are given. Implement the formulas so the Unit tests pass.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
