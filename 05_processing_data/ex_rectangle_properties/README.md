# Rectangle Properties

This application was build to determine the `area` and `circumference` of a rectangle. However the previous student programming this app forgot the formulas for both.

Both calculations need to be implemented in the methods `CalculateArea` and `CalculateCircumference` in the file `RectangleProperties\Rectangle.cs`.

Expected output:

```text
Rectangle: 3cm by 8cm
The rectangle has an area of 24sq centimeters.
The rectangle has an circumference of 22 centimeters.
```
