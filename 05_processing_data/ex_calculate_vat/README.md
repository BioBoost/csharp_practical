# Calculate VAT

When buying a product in the store you always need to pay VAT (taxes). Take for example a pair of shoes that costs 100eur net, you actually pay 121eur. On top of your net price, comes 21% VAT.

This application should allow you to calculate the VAT you need to pay. Implement the method `GetVAT` inside the file `CalculateVAT\Invoice.vs`.

Example output:

```text
For a net value of 250euro
you need to pay 21% VAT.
So the total price you pay is
250euro + 52.5euro = 302.5euro
```
