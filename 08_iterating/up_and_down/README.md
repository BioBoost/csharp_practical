# Up and Down

Create a new C# Console App (.NET Core).

Create some for-loop constructs to output the series of numbers shown below. You are not supposed to add login to the output code of the loop. Change the loop construct itself to make it generate the series of numbers you need. The body of the loop should only contain the code `Console.Write($"{i} ");`.

Series to generate:

```text
Looping [0, 10[: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Looping [1, 10]: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Looping [10, 0]: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Looping [0, 10] (even numbers): 0 2 4 6 8 10
Looping ]0, 100] (multiples of 11): 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
Looping [1, 10000] (i times 5): 1 5 25 125 625 3125
Looping [4096, 0[ (divided by 2): 4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
