### Roll Em All

Create a new C# Console App (.NET Core) to simulate a dice throwing game. Allow the user of your application to select the number of throws that can be simulated and also the number of eyes for the throws.

For example:

```text
This is a dice throwing simulator. Select the number of throws you wish to simulate and the eyes of the dice to use.

Number of throws to simulate? 3
Number of eyes of the dice to use? 20

Throw 1: 12
Throw 2: 2
Throw 3: 19
```
