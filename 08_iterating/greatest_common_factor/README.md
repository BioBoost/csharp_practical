# Greatest Common Factor

Finish the application so it can determine the GCF (Greatest Common Factor) of two numbers. This is the highest number by which both numbers can be divided.

The code needs to be implemented in the class `MathHelper`.

Some tips:

* Make sure to use the absolute values to determine the GCF.
* If either of the values is `0`, you can return the none-zero number or `0` if both are `0`.

Example output:

```text
Welcome to the greatest common factor finder.

Please input your first value: -24
Please input your second value: 16

The greatest common factor of -24 and 16 is: 8
```
