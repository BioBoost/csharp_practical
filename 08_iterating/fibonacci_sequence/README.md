# Fibonacci Sequence

Create an application that calculates the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and outputs them to the terminal. Calculate the sum of the numbers. It should be `17710`.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that, every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. Start the series at the number 1.

Example:

```text
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
```

Once finished extend the application by letting the user decide at the start of your application how many numbers to generate.
