# Higher Lower

Create the higher / lower game. First the application should generate a secret random number. The user is then requested to enter numbers. After each guess you should output to the user if he/she has to guess higher or lower.

If the secret number is guessed, output a congratulations to the user.

As an extra you can also output the number of guesses that were needed to guess the number.

## Extra

Limit the number of tries for the user. Show a progress bar of some kind to the user indicating how many guesses are left.

Example:

```text
