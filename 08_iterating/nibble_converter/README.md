# Nibble Converter

This application should allow a user to enter a positive decimal value and convert it to a hexadecimal string.

Example:

```text
Welcome to the Nibble Converter.

Please enter any positive value: 123

The decimal value 123, is represented in hex as: 0x7B
```

Another example:

```text
Welcome to the Nibble Converter.

Please enter any positive value: 12345

The decimal value 12345, is represented in hex as: 0x3039
```

Make sure that the hex values always contain an even number of nibbles. If not, pad a zero in front.
