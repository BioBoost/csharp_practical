# Visual Rectangle

Create a new C# Console Application (.NET Core). This application should allow the user to draw a rectangle in the terminal. Show a nice menu to the user and ask him/her what to do, draw a filled rectangle or non-filled. Next request the `heigh` and `width`.

Example:

```text
Welcome to the Rectangle Visualizer.

Please choose your next action:
- filled: Draw a filled rectangle
- outline: Draw a non-filled rectangle

Please make a choice: outline

How many characters would you like to use for the width: 5
How many characters would you like to use for the height: 3

Processing ...

Output:
* * * * *
*       *
* * * * *
```

## Extra

You can also ask the user which character should be used to draw the rectangle. The above example uses an asterisk `*`.
