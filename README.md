# CSharp Practical

This repository belongs to: **YOUR_NAME_HERE**

This repository contains the exercises and challenges that accompany the C\# course at VIVES University of Applied Sciences at Bruges which can be found at [http://base-to-ace.netlify.com](http://base-to-ace.netlify.com).

Each chapter may contain both a number of exercises as well as challenges. Exercises come with solutions, challenges do not.

All exercises and challenges contain at least a `README.md` describing the task at hand. Most already contain a Visual Studio solution to start from.

## Starting as a Student

To get started you will first need to get a copy of this repository. Follow the steps below to get your own personal copy. This only needs to be done once.

1. Get the GitHub classroom invitation link from Toledo
2. Accept the assignment
3. Wait for your own personal copy to be created (can take up to several minutes)
4. Open the GitHub page of your repository
5. Copy the ssh clone-url (green button) that looks like `git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp_practical-<username>.git`
6. Traverse to a local directory on your system where you wish to clone the repo using Windows Explorer. Open PowerShell in that location by typing `powershell` in the location bar as shown in the screenshot below.

*Please don't choose a destination directory that is nested very deeply. The structure of this repo introduces quite a lot of subdirectories and might give problems towards maximum path length in Windows.*

7. Issue the `git clone` command followed by the url you copied.

```shell
git clone <place-ssh-url-here>
```

You should get the following output:

```text
Cloning into 'csharp-practical-BioBoost'...
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.113' to the list of known hosts.
remote: Enumerating objects: 185, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (109/109), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (185/185), 128.22 KiB | 625.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (57/57), done.
```

Now you should have your local copy of the repository.

All git commands in other sections should always be executed inside of the project dir called `csharp-practical-<username>`.

## Committing Changes

Changes can be committed and pushed back to GitHub using the terminal.

Traverse to your local `csharp-practical-<username>` directory and type `powershell` in the location bar as done previously in [section Starting as a Student](#starting-as-a-student).

1. Add all changed files: `git add .`
2. Commit the files and add a message: `git commit -m "My message goes here"`
3. Push your changes to GitHub: `git push origin master`

4. To make sure all is well, you can always issue the command `git status`, even in between other commands.

You can also navigate to your GitHub page of this repo and check if all went well.

Make it a habit of committing regularly. At least after solving each assignment.

Also checkout the [shortened version of these steps for everyday use](./short_instructions.md).

## Pulling the Latest Updates

To pull the latest updates you will first need to add the original repo on which this one was based. This only needs to be done once for every cloned instance:

```shell
git remote add base git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp_practical.git
```

`base` is the name of remote repo. Now you should see two remotes when issuing the command `git remote -v`. For example:

```text
base     git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp_practical.git (fetch)
base     git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp_practical.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp-practical-BioBoost.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:vives-introduction-to-programming-2019/csharp-practical-BioBoost.git (push)
```

Now every time you wish to pull updates you need to follow these steps:

1. First make sure that you have no local changes. This can be seen by executing `git status`. It should state `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. If not, you first need to add and commit the changes (see section [Committing Changes](#committing-changes)).
2. Now issue the command `git pull base master` to pull the latest changes.

## Overview

Please indicate which challenges you have finished by placing a ‚úîÔ∏è emoji in the finished column. These were found at [https://emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

## xUnit Tests

Unit Tests allow code to be tested automatically for correctness.

Some exercises/challenges might be accompanied by these tests (üëç in `Unit Tests?` column).

Open the `Test Explorer` overview in Visual Studio by navigating to `Test => Windows => Test Explorer`.

Hit the first green arrow at the top left (Run All):

![Run All Tests](./img/run_all_unit_tests.png)

Normally the tests will always fail in the beginning.

![Failing Tests](./img/failing_tests.png)

If the challenge/exercise is solved correctly, all tests should pass.
