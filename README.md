# CSharp Practical

This repository contains the exercises and challenges that accompany the C\# course at VIVES University of Applied Sciences at Bruges which can be found at [https://hardcore-archimedes-bf4fb0.netlify.com/](https://hardcore-archimedes-bf4fb0.netlify.com/).

Each chapter may contain both a number of exercises as well as challenges. Exercises come with solutions, challenges do not.

All exercises and challenges contain at least a `README.md` describing the task at hand. Most already contain a Visual Studio solution to start from.
