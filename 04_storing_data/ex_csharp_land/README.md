# RollerCoaster

The C# RollerCoaster app is an app that informs the passengers of the minimum required height to rider the rollercoaster. However, a small bug has slipped into the code and the programmer did not initialize the variable correctly that stores the minimum height.

Please correct the mistake and set the minimum required height to `1m and 30cm`.

Change the code in the method `ShowMinimumHeight` in the file `CSharpLand\RollerCoaster.cs`.
