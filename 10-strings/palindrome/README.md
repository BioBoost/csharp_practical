# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number or phrase of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as `radar` or `madam` or `racecar` or the number `10801`.

Implement the method `IsPalindrome(string word)` in the class `Palindrome` so it returns a boolean value indicating if the string is a palindrome or not.

Make sure to convert the word to lowercase before starting your check. You should also apply the `Trim()` method to remove all whitespace before and after the word.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
