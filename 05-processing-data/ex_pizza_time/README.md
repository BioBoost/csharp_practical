# Pizza Time

This little app lets us divide slices of pizza among people. Everyone gets his/her fair share.

Two methods need to implemented inside of the file `PizzaTime\PizzaDivider.cs`:

* `HowManySlicesPerPerson()`: Should calculate how many slices everyone gets. Fairly divided.
* `HowManySlicesLeft()`: Determines how many slices are left after everyone gets his/her fair share.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
