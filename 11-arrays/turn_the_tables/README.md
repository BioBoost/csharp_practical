# Turn the Tables

Turn the Tables is a small App to teach children the tables of multiplications. Just input a multiplier and it will output the first 10 values.

However, there is a small catch. The actual method `int[] Multiply(int[] left, int[] right)` that needs to implement the multiplication is missing its code. Can you retrieve it?

## Expected Output

```text
Welcome to Turn the Tables ...
This app can calculate a table of multiplications.

Please enter your desired multiplier: 7
Lets output an example:

The table of multiplication for the number 7:
0 x 7 = 0
1 x 7 = 7
2 x 7 = 14
3 x 7 = 21
4 x 7 = 28
5 x 7 = 35
6 x 7 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 7 = 56
9 x 7 = 63

Thank you for using Turn the Tables
```
