So you decide to make a small convenient application that helps you calculate the cost of your trip.

By also taking the size of the car fuel tank into account, the application can also determine how often the user will have to tank while on the road.

To determine the cost you will need basic some information from the user:

* the number of kilometers the trip consists of
* the fuel usage of the car per 100 kilometers
* the current price of fuel per liter
* the size of the car tank in liters

Hello and welcome to drive "Far From Home". This small application can determine how
fuel you need to take a trip from source to destination. It will also determine how
much the trip will cost you and how many times you will need to fill up the car.

Before all this can be calculated we do require some information from you:

1. Please supply the length of the trip [km]: 734
2. What is the fuel usage of the car you will be driving [l/100km]: 6,2
3. What is the current average fuel price per liter [eur/l]: 2,05
4. How much liters can your gas tank hold [l]: 33

Calculating ...

Here is the outcome:

For a trip of 735km you will need 45,508l of fuel.
That means this trip will cost you 93,2914eur at a gas price of 2,05eur/l.
For this trip you will need to stop 1 times(s) to fuel up.

Thank you for using our fuel calculator.
