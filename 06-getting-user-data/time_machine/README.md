# Time Machine

The year is 2014. You just turned 14 years old but you are already a wizz-kid with computers. While programming in C# you discovered some hidden classes inside the system that allowed you to manipulate time (sorry, no space).

You developed a class called `Clock` that allows you to jump forward in time. All that remains is to implement the methods that allow you to jump a number of hours (`AddHours()`) and a number of minutes (`AddMinutes()`) forward.

Last but not least, you want to share your app with the world. To do this you will need to make it more user friendly. Change the `Main()` application a bit so the user can enter the number of minutes and hours he/she wants to jump forward.

Example Output:

```text
Welcome to your personal time machine.

The current time is
Time: 21:11

How much minutes would you like to jump forward? 182
How much hours would you like to jump forward? 12

Congratz. You jumped forward in time to
Time: 12:13
```
