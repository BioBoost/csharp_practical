# How Many Times

This app allows a user to enter a text and a word. The app will search the text for the word and count how many times the word appears in the text.

Well at least that's the idea, but the functionality is not there yet.

Implement the method `SearchAndCount(string text, string word)` in the class `StringFinder` to search and count the number of occurrences of the string `word` inside the `text`.

The implementation should treat lowercase and uppercase versions the same.

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
