# Biggest Number

The Biggest Number app allows you to determine the biggest number out of three. However its lacking some implementation.

Add the logic to determine the biggest number inside of the methode `DetermineBiggest` of the class `Biggest`. Make sure that it also works with negative numbers.

Example output:

```text
The biggest number of (1, -3, 104) = 104
The biggest number of (-5, 11, 3) = 11
The biggest number of (0, 109, 66) = 109
```
