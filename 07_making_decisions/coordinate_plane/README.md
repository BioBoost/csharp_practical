# Coordinate Plane

Request both the `x` and `y` value of a point in 2D space from the user. Use the coordinates to determine in which quadrant the coordinates lie. This needs to be implemented in the `Point` class.

Create a `Main` app that requests the coordinates from the user as shown below.

Expected output:

```text
Welcome to the Coordinate Plane App

Please enter the x-coordinate: 12.32
Please enter the y-coordinate: -74.2

The point (12.32,-74.2) lies in the fourth quadrant.
```

Or when entering `(0,0)`:

```text
Welcome to the Coordinate Plane App

Please enter the x-coordinate: 0
Please enter the y-coordinate: 0

The point (0,0) lies in the origin.
```

## Unit Tests

This project has accompanying unit tests. See [xUnit Tests](/README.md#xunit-tests) on how to run them.
