Welcome to my number properties app.
Input two integral numbers and I will tell you some important characteristics about them.
You can even input negative numbers.

Please input the first number: 15
Please input the second number: -30

Thank you. Here is some info about these numbers:
    - (15) + (-30) = -15
    - (15) - (-30) = 45
    - The first number (15) is the biggest
    - The first number (15) is:
        - uneven
        - positive
        - square is 225
