# Biggest of them All

Biggest of them All is an application that can determine the biggest number in an array. Are you up for the challenge?

Two tasks need to be accomplished:

* Add an implementation to the method `int BiggestValue(int[] values)` in the class `ArrayAnalyzer` and make it return the value of the biggest number inside of the array `values`.
* Also add an implementation to the method `int BiggestIndex(int[] values)` in the class `ArrayAnalyzer` and make it return the index of the biggest number inside of the array `values`.

In case of multiple occurrences return the first one.

## Expected Output

```text

Once finished, hit enter.
