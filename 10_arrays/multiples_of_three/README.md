# Multiples of Three

Multiples of Three is a small application that can output the multiples of the number 3. Simple but effective.

Implement the method `generate()` in `MultipleGenerator` so it generates the array of integers.

## Expected Output

```text
Welcome to Multiples of Three ...
This app prints out the first 10 multiples of three

List of multiples:
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30

Thank you for using Multiples of Three
```
