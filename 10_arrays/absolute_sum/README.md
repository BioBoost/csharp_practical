# Absolute Sum

Absolute Sum is a small application that can determine the sum of the absolute values of an array of integers.

Your task (also see `View => Task List` in Visual Studio):

* Implement the method `Sum()` in the class `Summator` so it iterates over the array `values` and determines the sum of the absolute values.
* If `values` does not contain any elements (`Length` is `0`), then the method should return the value `0`.

## Expected Output

```text
Welcome to Summator. Your absolute truth to summation.

The sum of 1 2 3 4 5 is 15

Thank you for using our app.
```

## Unit Tests
