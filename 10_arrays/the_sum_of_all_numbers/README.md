# The Sum of All Numbers

The Sum of All Numbers is a small application that can determine the sum of an array of integers inputted by the user.

Implement the method `int CalculateSum(int[] numbers)` in `SumOfIntegers` so it calculates the sum from the array of integers. Use a for-loop construct to do this.

## Expected Output
