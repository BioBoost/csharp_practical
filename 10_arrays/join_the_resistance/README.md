# Join the Resistance

Write a new console application (.NET Core) that can converts the color band on a resistor to its actual resistance value. Allow the user to enter the colors of the bands.

Use an array to store the possible colors.

The application should only provide support for 4-band resistors.

Start with the value and you can later extend the app to support the tolerance.

## Example Output

```text
Welcome to the Next-Gen Resistor Calculator

First you will be asked for the foremost left color bands that determine the value. Next you may provide the tolerance band.

Possible colors are: [black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, grey, white]

Band 1: red
Band 2: violet
Band 3: red

Possible tolerance colors are: [silver, gold, brown, red, green, blue, violet, grey]

Tolerance band: brown

The resistor has a value of 2700 +- 1%

Thank you for using our app.
