# Toss a Die to Your Witcher

This app simulates a die throw which can be used for boardgames. It generates a value between `0` and `6`. However the application developer forgot to actually call the method that generates the die throw.

Fix the application by calling the method `ThrowDie` in `Main` and store the result in the variable `dieValue` which is then outputted to the terminal.

Expected Output:

```text
Throwing a die ...
Cool, we threw 3
```

Ofcourse the thrown value changes everytime you run the application.
