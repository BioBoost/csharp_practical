# Its all About Timing

In this we will try to convert a given number of seconds into a timestamp with the following format: `DDd HH:MM:SS`

Where:

* `DD` are the number of days
* `HH` are the number of hours
* `MM` are the number of minutes
* `SS` are the remaining number of seconds

Allow the user to input the number of seconds he/she wishes to convert to the timestamp.

Make sure to create methods for all the different conversions.

Remembers there are methods you can call on a `string` such as `PadLeft` to add leading zeros.

Expected output:

```text
Welcome to Its All About Timing

Please enter a total number of seconds and the App
will convert it to a timestamp.

Seconds: 1236334

Timestamp: 14d 07:25:34
```

You can always check your result by making the reverse calculation.
