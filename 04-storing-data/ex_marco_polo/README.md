# Marco Polo

This application tries to display some personal information about a guy named "Marco Polo". However, some parts of the code are not finished yet.

There are three methods in the file `MarcoPolo\PersonalInformation.cs` that need some extra work:

* `FullName`: Concatenate `firstname` and `lastname` and assign the result to the variable `fullname`
* `Age`: Initialize `age` to 19
* `EyeColor`: Set the color of my eyes to blue

Expected output:

```text
Hello, I am Marco Polo
I am 19 years of age.
I have fancy blue colored eyes.
```
