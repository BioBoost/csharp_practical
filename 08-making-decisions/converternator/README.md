# ConverterNator

The ConverterNator is the next gen conversion app that allows metric to imperial unit conversions and vice versa.

Your task is to implement the conversions between miles and kilometers and also those between pounds and kilograms. This needs to be done inside of the class `Converter`.

Next you also need to build the application that will be presented to our clients. It should allow all conversions by means of a menu. This allows the user to pick a conversion of his/her liking. This needs to be implemented inside of the `Main` method.

Example Output:

```text
Welcome to the next gen ConverterNator. Please select an option:
1. Miles to kilometers
2. Kilometers to miles
3. Pounds to kilograms
4. Kilograms to pounds
5. Exit
Your choice: 1

Ready to convert miles to kilometers.
Please enter the value to convert: 10
10 miles equals 16.09344 kilometers.

Thank you for using our ConverterNator App.
