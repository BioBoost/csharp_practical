# Personal Details

Complete the application so it prints out some personal information about yourself, like for example:

* your name
* your age
* your height
* your weight
* the color of your eyes
* ...

Try to concatenate strings with actual numbers like for example:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("I am " + 3.2 + " feet tall");
```
