### Personal Details

Create an application that prints out some personal information about yourself, like for example:
* your name
* your age
* your height
* your weight
* the color of your eyes
* ...

Try to concatenate strings with actual numbers like for example:
```java
System.out.println("I am " + 3 + " feet tall");
```
