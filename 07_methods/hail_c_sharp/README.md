# Hail C Sharp

It's time to tell C# what we think about it. I have prepared a method `HailCSharp` that outputs a statement about C# to the terminal.

Call the method in `Main` so the following output is generated when the application runs:

```text
C# is good starter language as its syntax is easy to learn.
Microsoft first time use the name C# in 1988.
C# can also be used to develop games.
```
