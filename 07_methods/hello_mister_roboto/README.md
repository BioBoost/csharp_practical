# Hello Mister Roboto

Hello Mister Roboto is the start of Bot in C#. It is a project created by a former student but it actually never really did anything. To encourage students to continue the project the application should at least output a welcome message to the user.

First create a method `GreetTheUser()` that outputs the following message to the terminal:

```text
Hello, I am Mister Roboto.
I am the next-gen chat-bot created by VIVES students.
```

Call the method from the main application so the message is outputted if the application runs.

Expected Output:

```text
Hello, I am Mister Roboto.
I am the next-gen chat-bot created by VIVES students.
```
